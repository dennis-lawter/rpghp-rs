* TODO Improve session secret/id system
    - In my previous rpghp project, I created a uuidv4 for the session secret, then the sha1 of that was the session id
    - Only the session id is stored in the DB, meaning secrets cannot be retrieved
    - The uuidv4 and sha1 of the uuidv4 can both be represented by a relatively small base64 in the url
* TODO Decide on a framework for the frontend, I'm leaning toward htmx
    - Can htmx use json bodies for the api, or is it only multiforms?
* TODO Probably need a new module for frontend intermediates, little ajaxable HTML pieces that can be queried
    - The POST endpoints on this intermediate?
        + If htmx can't construct json easily, this intermediate layer might be a place to do multiforms
        + otherwise the API could probably accept multiple input types
